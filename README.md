# sequexa-core

sequexa-core is a sequential model engine with a built-in autograd engine,
built on [wilupgu](https://github.com/superroket169/wilupgu), a
backend-independent tensor/dispatch library (wgpu / CUDA / CPU). It
prioritizes code cleanliness and extensibility over research-driven
experimentation: every kernel sits behind a single emitter, and the
Train / Prefill / Decode phase system (`GraphBuilder<Phase>`) makes using a
kernel in the wrong phase a compile error. Training and inference share the
same `ModelWeights` but build entirely separate graphs. No ML framework is
involved — every op (matmul, RMSNorm, flash attention, RoPE, AdamW,
cross-entropy and all backward passes) is a hand-written WGSL / CUDA C / CPU
kernel.

## Model: sequexa-hall 1.0

| | |
|---|---|
| Params | ~162M (lm_head untied from embedding) |
| Dim / Layers / Heads | 768 / 12 / 12 (head_dim 64) |
| FFN hidden | 3072 (SiLU) |
| Context | 512 |
| Vocab | 50257 (GPT-2 BPE) |
| Position / Norm | RoPE / RMSNorm |
| Trained | 440k steps on an RTX 4050, final loss ~3.6 |

## Usage

```bash
cargo run --release                           # train (expects data/train.txt; resumes from checkpoints/)
cargo run --release -- --chat                 # chat with checkpoints/model_final.bin
cargo run --release -- --chat --weights <p>   # chat with a specific checkpoint
cargo run --release --features cuda           # CUDA backend (NVIDIA)
cargo run --release --features cpu -- --chat --cpu   # CPU backend
```

- **Tokenizer**: a local `tokenizer.json` (or the `SEQUEXA_TOKENIZER` env var)
  is used if present; otherwise the GPT-2 tokenizer is downloaded once and a
  local copy is saved.
- **Training data**: `data/train.txt`, raw text of any size; tokenized ONCE
  into 16M-token shard files under `data/train_shards/` (delete the directory
  to re-tokenize). Training samples random windows from a small resident pool
  of shards (~256MB RAM) that rotates through the whole corpus. Checkpoints go
  to `checkpoints/model_step_<N>.bin` every `SAVE_EVERY` steps and training
  auto-resumes from the newest one. `scripts/train.{bat,sh}` wrap the run in
  an auto-restart loop.
- **Hyperparameters** all live in `src/config.rs`.
- **Diagnostics**: two manually-run correctness suites — `cargo run --release
  --bin diagnose_kernels` (raw kernel-vs-CPU-reference checks) and `cargo run
  --release --bin diagnose_model` (param count, grad flow, accumulation,
  memorization smoke, prefill/decode parity, KV-cache speedup — 6 checks at
  real hall_1 scale) — run whenever training looks wrong before blaming
  hyperparameters.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads=1   # ALWAYS single-threaded: parallel tests
                                 # create concurrent GPU devices and segfault
```
